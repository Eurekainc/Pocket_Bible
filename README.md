## About Pocket Bible

This project was built with requirements of one Church pastor. Through the whole project, used laravel as backend and pure javascript (ES 7). Most importantly, the challenge was working with localstroage offline. 

In recent days, Working with offline is not a hard thing because we have powerful PWA technology and also have so many features such as ServiceWorker, IndexedDB.
But at that time, PWA tech was in beginnig time. 
Finally, it is working well as live site.
