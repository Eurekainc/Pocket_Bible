# Pocket_Bible
 This project was built with requirements of one Church pastor. Through the whole project, used laravel as backend and pure javascript (ES 7).  Most importantly, the challenge was working with localstroage offline. At that time, PWA tech was in beginnig time. But now it is working well as live site.
